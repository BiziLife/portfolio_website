          How I Got Started in Software Engineering
        </h1>

        <p>
          When I was about 10 years old, I played Roblox. This platform wasn&apos;t just about playing gamesâ€”it 
          also allowed players to create their own games. I downloaded Roblox Studio, the software for developing 
          games, and quickly realized I needed to learn a programming language called Lua. I watched many YouTube 
          tutorials on game development and programming, but eventually, I gave up on this passion.

          Fortunately, I had the opportunity to take STEM classes in school, which I enjoyed. I learned how to create basic web 
          pages and made a game in Scratch using block-based coding! My passion for technology stayed with me throughout 
          high school. When choosing a college major, I decided on software engineering because I was excited to develop 
          applications, games, and websites.
